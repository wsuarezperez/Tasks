/*Create main method!!!!!!!!!!!!
Scanner Class and Switch case is needed for this Assignment

Write a program using the switch statement  
Let us consider the scenario regarding the born baby age 

First Output: "enter the age of the Child"

case 1: if age is 1 print as "You can Crawl"

case 2 : if age is 2 print as  "You can Talk"

case 3: If age is 3 print as "You can Dance"

case 4: if age is 4 print as "You can get  Trouble"

other than this age (1-4) it should print "I don't know how old you are"
