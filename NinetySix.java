package eclipse;
/*1. Complete the Dog.java class:

Include the following class variables:
dogName, dogWeight and  
dogBreed=Mutt;
All class variables should be declared lowercase, also make dogBreed static

Write two constructors:
* The main constructor(with all parameters)
* A secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight 

2. Test your code with the Main.java class:

Create a Dog object using both Constructors and print their 
fields/states to make sure it's correct.

Output:
1.The main constructor(with all parameters)=Tarzan Mutt 50.0

2.secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight 
(Breed defaults to "Mutt")
=Tarzan Mutt 50.0
